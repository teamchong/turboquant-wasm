 * Typical use:
 *
 * {
 *  rk_state state;
 *  unsigned long seed = 1, random_value;
 *
 *  rk_seed(seed, &state); // Initialize the RNG
 *  ...
 *  random_value = rk_random(&state); // Generate random values in [0..RK_MAX]
 * }
 *
 * Instead of rk_seed, you can use rk_randomseed which will get a random seed
 * from /dev/urandom (or the clock, if /dev/urandom is unavailable):
 *
 * {
 *  rk_state state;
 *  unsigned long random_value;
 *
 *  rk_randomseed(&state); // Initialize the RNG with a random seed
 *  ...
 *  random_value = rk_random(&state); // Generate random values in [0..RK_MAX]
 * }
 */

/*
 * Useful macro:
 *  RK_DEV_RANDOM: the device used for random seeding.
 *                 defaults to "/dev/urandom"
